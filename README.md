                                              📸 Computer Vision Journey — From Basics to Advanced Techniques

This repository documents my end-to-end journey in Computer Vision, starting from foundational image processing methods to advanced algorithms and real-world projects. It includes hands-on experiments, well-structured code examples, and practical implementations that showcase growth, learning, and application of CV concepts.

What’s Inside:

 1. Basic Techniques: Image reading/writing, color spaces, filtering, thresholding, contours, edge detection, transformations, etc.

 2. Advanced Techniques: Feature extraction, object detection, face recognition, deep learning integrations, classical ML techniques, and optimization.

 3. Projects: Real-world mini-projects and full applications demonstrating practical use cases in computer vision.

This repository will continue to evolve as I explore more techniques, tools, and frameworks in the CV ecosystem.
